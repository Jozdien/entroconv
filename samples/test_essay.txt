When you open your eyes and look at the room around you, you'll locate your laptop in relation to the table, and you'll locate a bookcase in relation to the wall. If something goes wrong with your eyes, or your brain, then your mental model might say there's a bookcase where no bookcase exists, and when you go over to get a book, you'll be disappointed.

This is what it's like to have a false belief, a map of the world that doesn't correspond to the territory.
